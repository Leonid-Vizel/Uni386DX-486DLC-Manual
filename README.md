# UNI-386DX/486DLC User's Manual

Found some really old motherboard user manual while cleaning.

I guess it's from my grandpa's old computer (he sold it or threw it away a long time ago, cause I was not able to find the motherboard itself).

Maybe someone will need it for old hardware necromancy, so I scanned it all at best quality, have fun :)
